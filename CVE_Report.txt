Impact: None
Public: 2014-12-28
Statement: N/A
Details: ** DISPUTED ** The apprentice_load function in libmagic/apprentice.c in the Fileinfo component in PHP through 5.6.4 attempts to perform a free operation on a stack-based character array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors. NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because the standard erealloc behavior makes the free operation unreachable.

CVE URL: https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9427
Impact: Low
Public: 2014-12-17
Statement: This flaw requires that a user is able to upload arbitrary PHP code on the system, be a local user able to execute arbitrary PHP code, or have the ability to modify existing PHP code on the system. It also requires that the modified/arbitrary PHP code is executed with the php-cgi program, and the net result is that php-cgi crashes, effectively resulting in a self-denial of service.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.
Details: sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in the CGI component in PHP through 5.4.36, 5.5.x through 5.5.20, and 5.6.x through 5.6.4, when mmap is used to read a .php file, does not properly consider the mapping's length during processing of an invalid file that begins with a # character and lacks a newline character, which causes an out-of-bounds read and might (1) allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from php-cgi process memory by leveraging the ability to upload a .php file or (2) trigger unexpected code execution if a valid PHP script is present in memory locations adjacent to the mapping.

Statement: This issue affects the version of openssl098e as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact and does not plan to address this flaw for the above components in any future security updates.

This issue affects the version of openssl and openssl097a as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.
Details: It was discovered that OpenSSL would accept ephemeral RSA keys when using non-export RSA cipher suites. A malicious server could make a TLS/SSL client using OpenSSL use a weaker key exchange method.
